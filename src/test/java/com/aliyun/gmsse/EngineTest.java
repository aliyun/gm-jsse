/**
 * A SSLEngine usage example which simplifies the presentation
 * by removing the I/O and multi-threading concerns.
 *
 * The demo creates two SSLEngines, simulating a client and server.
 * The "transport" layer consists two ByteBuffers:  think of them
 * as directly connected pipes.
 *
 * Note, this is a *very* simple example: real code will be much more
 * involved.  For example, different threading and I/O models could be
 * used, transport mechanisms could close unexpectedly, and so on.
 *
 * When this application runs, notice that several messages
 * (wrap/unwrap) pass before any application data is consumed or
 * produced.  (For more information, please see the SSL/TLS
 * specifications.)  There may several steps for a successful handshake,
 * so it's typical to see the following series of operations:
 *
 *      client          server          message
 *      ======          ======          =======
 *      wrap()          ...             ClientHello
 *      ...             unwrap()        ClientHello
 *      ...             wrap()          ServerHello/Certificate
 *      unwrap()        ...             ServerHello/Certificate
 *      wrap()          ...             ClientKeyExchange
 *      wrap()          ...             ChangeCipherSpec
 *      wrap()          ...             Finished
 *      ...             unwrap()        ClientKeyExchange
 *      ...             unwrap()        ChangeCipherSpec
 *      ...             unwrap()        Finished
 *      ...             wrap()          ChangeCipherSpec
 *      ...             wrap()          Finished
 *      unwrap()        ...             ChangeCipherSpec
 *      unwrap()        ...             Finished
